# My Python Journey

Hi, I'm Ege 
I'm currently learning Python and this is where I store all the lessons and exercises I practice.  
This repository is like my public notebook — starting from the basics and slowly leveling up. 


# What's Inside?

Each file is a mini-lesson:

- `lesson_1_hello_world.py` → My first line of code
- `lesson_2_draw_square.py` → Drawing a square using turtle
- `lesson_3_draw_triangle.py` → Drawing a triangle
- `lesson_4_string.py` → Working with string data
- `lesson_5_integer.py` → Integer numbers
- `lesson_6_float.py` → Floating point numbers
- `lesson_7_boolean.py` → Boolean values
- `lesson_8_example.py` → Average age (example)
- `lesson_9_example2.py` → Average of exam scores

…and many more coming soon 



# Why This Exists?

I'm on a mission to:

- Become really good at Python before January 2026
- Track my progress day by day
- Share what I learn with others

Stay tuned!
