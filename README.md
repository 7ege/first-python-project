# My Python Journey

Hi, I'm Ege 
I'm currently learning Python and this is where I store all the lessons and exercises I practice.  
This repository is like my public notebook â€” starting from the basics and slowly leveling up. 

# Why This Exists?

I'm on a mission to:

- Become really good at Python before January 2026
- Track my progress day by day
- Share what I learn with others

Stay tuned!
